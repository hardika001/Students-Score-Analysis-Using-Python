# Students Score Analysis 

### Problem Statement
This project aims to provide insights into how the Score of Students depends on various factors and what steps should be taken to maintain or increase the result. Providing a comprehensive and accessible solution by leveraging Python libraries for data analysis, the tool seeks to empower users to effortlessly import, explore, and derive insights from a fictional student dataset. The overarching goal is to bridge the gap between raw academic data and actionable insights, fostering data-driven decision-making in the field of education.

### Questions Explored
1.	What is the Gender Distribution?
2.	What is the Impact of Parent's Education on Student’s Score?
3.	What is the Impact of a Parent's Marital Status on a Student's Score?
4.	Student’s Score based on Gender?
5.	What is the Impact of Sports on Student's Scores?
6.	What is the Impact of Study Hours on Scores?

From the Above Chart we have analyzed that: 
There are highest students from Ethnic Group C followed by Group D and Group B


## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Insights
- Students whose Parents are more Educated are likely to Score higher marks
- Students who play Sports Regularly can score comparatively high marks, so we should encourage them to be involved in sports too with studies
- Female students score more than male students except in the case of Maths
- Students who studied more than 10 hours weekly can score more marks followed by those who can studied between 5 to 10 hours
  but the students who studied less than 5 hours scored comparatively low marks
